===========

We are now fully established with some great support for our concept and need the help of the communities to help build our Official Website, Blog, Portfolio &amp; Initiative Backend - for the New (SharingDev) Shared Projects Collab Initiative.
We have no Web Designers or Wordpress Developers/Designers on staff and our usual Front-End Coder is away on a full-time job for approx 6mths. 
We are pleading to the community to help us with any skills you can bring to the table. We have a part-time Illustrator on staff, mainly great with Mascots and full page Illustrations and Graphic Designer specializing in Graphic Web Elements and our Graphic Research & Marketing Team for extra inspiration in the creative arena as far as how we should be presented to the public and most importantly to potential new Staff Members, Contributers, Helpers, Supporters, Sponsors and Developers/Designers & Coders of all area's as a fun and exciting new outfit to be doing outstanding TOP TRENDING Web Services, Web Applications and eventually Mobile Apps for.

What Makes us Different? We had a thought one day working on a project that we could use a whole peice of an open source PHP/mSQL code that was the perfect 'base' to build from for what we were working on - and the Idea was Born!
...Use as much open source, (CC) Licensed etc scripts, code, graphic elements and so on from all these new repositories popping up, Google Codes and get these developers/designers/coders/artists names/contributions out there on a finished project backed by a Top Collaboration Initiative that not only uses peices BUT ALSO GIVES BACK to these same Repositories parts of the Web Services, Web Applications we are working on such as Icon Sets for example to CSS3-jQuery coolness or a nice BootStrap idea we came up with for a certain feature or function that could be added on to and enchanced by the community and ourselves when time is spare.

SharingDev is our Twitter Username, and I think that explains who we are and what we are passionate about - Getting peices out there into a workable and fantastic idea for the next Simple to Advanced Web Application or Full Web Service,  and thanks to the hours others have spent creating cool code, design possibilities and smarter and trendy ways to develop and more being added daily - we are in the right atmosphere to help others make names for themeselves by offering collaborating positions and get cool open source code out there when possible and also by giving back to these communities by offering our own repositories, projects for other like minded creatives to work on and add to their Portfolio's and of course create AWESOME Websites and Services!
